          Comedian Kapil Sharma will soon bring back his
          <span id="tkss">The Kapil Sharma Show</span> back on television. Just
          three months after going off-air, Kapil Sharma will bring back the new
          season of his show in September. As per the report India Today, The
          Kapil Sharma Show will replace Archana Puran Singh-Shekhar Suman's
          India's Laughter Challenge on Sony and will air its first episode on
          September 3.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last episode of TKSS was aired on June 5 with the stars of JugJugg
          Jeeyo, Anil Kapoor, Varun Dhawan, and Kiara Advani. After their show,
          Kapil Sharma and his team (Krushna Abhishek, Chandan Prabhakar, Kiku
          Sharda, Sumona Chakravarti) jetted off to Vancouver, Canada, and the
          US for stage shows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting in 2016, TKSS went on to become one of the most popular chat
          shows. Sharma and his gang have been host to the biggest names in the
          film industry. Due to Covid-19, the show was discontinued for a while,
          but the show returned with a new season in August 2021. Speaking about
          Archana Puran Singh's India's Laughter Challenge, the stand-up format
          comedy show failed to entertain its viewers. When it comes to
          comparison, Archana's show couldn't reach up to the benchmark set by
          Sharma's gang.
